        <h3>Sarpino's Pizzeria's Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. As part of the operations of Sarpino's Pizzeria, we gather certain types of information about Sarpino's users. This Privacy Policy explains the types of information we gather, what we do with it and how you may correct or change information that Sarpino's may collect.</p>
        <p>Our data protection policy (Privacy Policy) is displayed on the web site and the policy is set out in the same language medium as the web site. We encourage all our customers to read our Privacy Policy to understand our objective of collection for their personal data.</p>

        <h3>Information Collected by Sarpino's Pizzeria</h3>
        <p>Sarpino's Pizzeria collects two types of information about users: personal information (such as name and e-mail address) and aggregate information (such as information about how many users log on to our sites on a daily basis).</p>

        <h3>Accountability</h3>
        <p>We will be responsible for all personal data collected. All personal data collected will be used and processed fairly and lawfully while in our possession or custody. We ensure all our customers that we would be accountable for our organisation's compliance to our Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h3>Personal Information</h3>

These services include receiving electronic newsletters, answering surveys, purchasing items, and entering contests and other promotional opportunities provided on our sites. We may collect personal information from you in other areas of our sites, but we will provide on-screen notification that we are doing so. We may receive personal usage and demographic information from our third-party partners, and we also collect e-mail addresses from users who send us support mail or request technical or other help. This information enables Sarpino's Pizzeria to improve our site to make your online visits more productive and enjoyable.</p>
        <p>Personal information collected will not be used for a new purpose unless we obtain consent from our customers. We are the sole owner of the personally identifiable information collected on this site. We collect personally identifiable information for the sole purpose of registering a user for our website. We do not collect sensitive information from our customers. We assure all customers that all personal information collected would be used or disclosed only for the purposes for which it was collected.</p>

        <h3>Collection</h3>
        <p>Only the necessary personal data is collected from customers' for business purposes. Both the amount and the type of data collected shall be limited to that which is necessary to fulfill the purposes identified.</p>

        <h3>Search Terms</h3>
        <p>As a measure of user interest, we track search terms that are entered into our sites' search features.

        <p>We will not disclose, share, transfer, sell or rent personally identifiable information to any 3rd party. Occasionally, we may post the name of a user (for example, a contest winner) on one of our sites. Sarpino's Pizzeria will notify you of this possibility when you provide your information or, if possible, will notify you when the information is posted.</p>
        <p>We do not send unsolicited marketing email to our customers. Customers will occasionally receive email on special promotions we hold. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, users may opt-out receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email.</p>
        <p>We do not keep personal data for longer than is necessary for those purposes for which they are collected.</p>
        <p>We have developed guidelines and implemented procedures to govern the destruction of personal data that are no longer required to fulfill the identified purposes.</p>

        <h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
        <p>Our sites contain links to sites other than our own. Those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as Sarpino's Pizzeria. Such links may be to advertisers, content providers or partners who may use our logo and/or style as a result of a co-branding agreement.

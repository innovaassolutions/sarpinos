      <p class="story-text">
        Sarpino's founder Gerry Koutougos established his first full service restaurant in Victoria, BC Canada. After years of providing authentic Italian and Mediterranean dishes through a number of successful full service restaurants, Gerry saw the opportunity to provide consumers around the world with these fresh authentic Italian dishes through take-out and delivery restaurants.

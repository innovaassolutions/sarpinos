# Sanity Studio - Intuitive Content Editing

Your Sanity Studio has been configured to be as intuitive as possible for non-technical users. No manual needed!

## What's Been Done

### ✅ Clear, Self-Explanatory Interface

Every field now includes:
- **Emoji icons** for visual recognition
- **Descriptive labels** that explain what each field does
- **Helpful placeholders** showing example content
- **Inline descriptions** explaining why each field matters
- **Smart validation** with friendly warnings

### ✅ Organized Content Structure

When you open Sanity Studio, you'll see:

```
✏️ Edit Your Website
├── 📄 Main Pages
│   ├── 🏠 Homepage Banner
│   └── ℹ️ About Us Page
├── 🎯 Promotions & Offers
├── 📍 Restaurant Locations
├── ⭐ Features & Highlights
└── ⚙️ Website Settings
```

## How Non-Technical Users Edit Content
